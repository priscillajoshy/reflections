When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  While collaborating with others on a project. It would enable everybody's code to be
  unified in a common shared space.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be other developers collaborating with you making changes at the remote.
	But you might not want their changes to be reflected on your local copy. It is more
	convenient to manually choose only the branch you are working on.
