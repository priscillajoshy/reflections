When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  While collaborating with others on a project. It would enable everybody's code to be
  unified in a common shared space.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be other developers collaborating with you making changes at the remote.
	But you might not want their changes to be reflected on your local copy. It is more
	convenient to manually choose only the branch you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks : when you want to use another user's repository and work on it collaboratively
	clones : when you want to use another repository by yourself
	branches : when you want to try an experimental feature

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To make sure you are working locally on the most uptodate version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	shared folder without version control is an option but it would be harder
