1.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		A .git folder is created. Need it to keep track of the files 
		in the folder.

2.	How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
	the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		It is an intermediate area between working directory and the
		repository. It contains files with changes under the same logic,
		which can be committed together as a logical unit. Helps to debug 
		or even break down the code easily at a later point.

3.	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
	per logical change?

		Add all files having changes related to the logical change into
		the staging area and commit it all together.

4.	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

		Gives a graphical representation of all commits made in the
		respective branches
