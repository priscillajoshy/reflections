1.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		A .git folder is created. Need it to keep track of the files 
		in the folder.

2.	How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
	the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		It is an intermediate area between working directory and the
		repository. It contains files with changes under the same logic,
		which can be committed together as a logical unit. Helps to debug 
		or even break down the code easily at a later point.
